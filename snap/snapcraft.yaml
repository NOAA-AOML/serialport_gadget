summary: Gadget to expose serial ports to snaps
description:
    This gadget will expose serial ports to a snap. The serial port 
    list seems to be generated using file globbing instead of regex. 
    The serial ports listed  will be similar to the list generated by 
    issuing the command  "ls /dev/tty[A-U]*". 
    This should list serial ports that fit the patterns 
    ttyS*,ttyUSB* and ttyACM*
    To use serial ports on your system make sure that the user is in the 
    dialout group. To add a user to the dialout group you can issue the
    following command. "sudo usermod -a -G dialout USERNAME"
    Afterwards logout and log back in.
